Known Bugs and Deviations from Specification:
- No known bugs. The shell successfully runs commands and handles pipelines.
- The 'cd' command works as expected.
- The shell exits on EOF (^D).
- Ctrl+C (^C) interrupts running commands but keeps the shell running.

Extra Credit Attempted:
- Implemented a custom shell prompt that displays the current working directory relative to the user's home directory.

Optional Enrichment Exercises (5% Extra Credit):
- The prompt now shows the directory path within the home directory.
- Example:
  slush|dir1/dir2>

Submission:
- `slush.c` (source code)
- `Makefile`
- `answers.txt`
